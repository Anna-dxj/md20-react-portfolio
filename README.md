# React Portfolio [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)]

## Description

This [webpage](https://anna-dxj.github.io/react-portfolio) is a professional portfolio for possible employers to look at my experience and previous work. This webpage features an "About Me" section, which provides a brief description of myself as well as a recent photo, a "Portfolio" section which includes my a screenshot, deployed link, repo link, and a brief description of my prevoius projects, a "Resume" section which includes my resume and a downloadable version of it, and finally a "Contact" section, which allows an employer to fill out and contact me. This webpage features a responsive navbar to direct to each section of the webpage and a footer to redirect to my profile links for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook.

On directing themselves to the webpage, potential employers should be routed to the "About Me" section: 
![screenshot-aboutme](./src/assets/screenshots/portfolio-screenshot.png)
  
Through development of this application, I have gained more comfort using React. This webpage, besides relying on react, also relies on Bootstrap for some icons and to easily handle responsive design and formatting.
